# Hey there! 👋

I'm Shreshth, a tech enthusiast trying to survive Information Technology at IIIT Gwalior. When I'm not debugging code that worked perfectly fine 5 minutes ago, you'll find me building stuff with React or helping fellow students avoid the mistakes I've already made (spoiler: they make them anyway).

## What keeps me busy 🎯
- Building web apps that occasionally work as intended
- Solving LeetCode problems while questioning my life choices (500+ problems and counting!)
- Teaching juniors how to center a div without crying
- Running tech events where I pretend to know what I'm talking about

## Bragging rights 🏆
- Competitive programming enthusiast (translation: I enjoy pain)
- Regular at hackathons (mostly for the free t-shirts)
- Decent ratings on CodeChef & Codeforces (my parents are still not impressed)
- Built some full-stack projects that actually made it to production (shocking, I know)
