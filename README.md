üëã **Hello, World!** (Yes, I'm starting with this clich√©). I'm Shreshth, currently masquerading as a student at IIIT Gwalior, where I'm supposedly mastering Information Technology. But let's be honest, most of the time, I'm just trying to make sure my code compiles without summoning a demon.

### üöÄ **What I Do**
- **Application Development:** I play with ReactJS and NodeJS, creating apps that sometimes surprise me by actually working.
- **Competitive Coding:** You can find me on LeetCode and Codechef, where I pretend to know what I'm doing.
- **Mentoring:** At IIIT Gwalior, I share my "wisdom" with newcomers, making sure they don't repeat my mistakes (or do they?).
- **Event Organizing:** I occasionally step away from my computer to interact with real humans, organizing tech events and workshops.

### üèÜ **Achievements I'm Forced to Brag About**
- Solved 500+ problems on LeetCode (and yes, it was as painful as it sounds).
- Attained some fancy ratings on Codechef and Codeforces.
- Managed to not completely ruin various hackathons and coding contests.

### üíª **Tech I Juggle With**
- **Languages:** C/C++, Solidity (and yes, I speak fluent sarcasm).
- **Frameworks:** ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS (the holy trinity).
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB (where I store my hopes and dreams).
- **Others:** Truffle, Git, Firebase, REST API (and a bunch of other impressive-sounding tools).

Drop me a line if you want to talk tech, exchange memes, or debate why coffee is the best coding companion. Or, you know, if you have a job offer (just saying).
