I'm an university student at Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior who lives in India. I am melophile who finds coding fun. I enjoy programming in C++ and Javascript because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS and exploring Data Structures and Algorithm.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on furnishing my skills.
- 😀 I like to code, read, and draw in my free time.
- 👨‍💼 You can find my Resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5gxm9SgwroS2juUtHYc7nYl0cdbIXtc/view?usp=sharing)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
